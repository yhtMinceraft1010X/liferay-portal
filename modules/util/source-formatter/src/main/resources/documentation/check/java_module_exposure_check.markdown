## JavaModuleExposureCheck

Exported types in API modules should not expose SPI types at signature level.
Once an SPI type is exposed via an API type, it is practically promoted to become an API.

You should consider:
* Move the exposed SPI types to API modules to make them formal APIs
* Make a cleaner separation to prevent SPI types from being exposed by APIs
