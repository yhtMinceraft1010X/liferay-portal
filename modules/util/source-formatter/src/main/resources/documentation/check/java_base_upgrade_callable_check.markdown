## JavaBaseUpgradeCallableCheck

When using `Callable` or `Runnable` in `Upgrade` or `Verify` classes, we must use
`BaseUpgradeCallable` instead. With this, we ensure the `CompanyThreadLocal` value
is passed to child threads.

The only difference is that we need to override `doCall()` instead of `call()`.

### Example

Incorrect:

```java
	private class MyCallable implements Callable<Boolean> {

        public MyCallable() {
        }

        @Override
        public Boolean call() {
        }
    }
```

Correct:

```java
	private class MyUpgradeCallable extends BaseUpgradeCallable<Boolean> {

	public MyCallable() {
	}

	@Override
	protected Boolean doCall() {
	}
}
```
