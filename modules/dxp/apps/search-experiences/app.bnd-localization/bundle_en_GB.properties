liferay-releng-app-description=The ${liferay.releng.app.title.prefix} Enterprise Search Experiences app includes a suite of features that unlock the full potential of Liferay's search framework for all Liferay users. The initial release introduces the "Search Blueprints" feature. With Blueprints, search administrators can<br /><br />* Tweak Liferay's default search behavior, or completely override it<br />* Provide context-aware search results based on the search user's attributes<br /><br />Search Blueprints enables search administrators to refine Liferay's default search behavior or build completely custom search algorithms using a no-code visual query builder. Each Blueprint is composed of multiple building blocks called "Elements"; each Element influences the search query in some way. For example, compose a Blueprint by adding one Element that hides content tagged "expired", another that ignores comments, and another that includes fields normally ignored by the default search algorithm.<br /><br />You can configure each Element using familiar UI controls like input fields, dropdown lists, and date pickers. Several convenient elements are included with the Blueprints app (e.g., Elements for boosting results by geolocation, content freshness, time-based conditional boosts, etc.). In addition, you can create new Elements to harness the full capabilities of Liferay's search framework.<br /><br />Search Blueprints are context-aware. You can provide personalised search results based on the user's profile, roles, location, local time, segment, etc. For example, a Blueprint can boost manufacturing industry case studies based on the user's email address or job title.<br /><br />Each search page can use a different Blueprint, allowing unique search algorithms for different search use cases like intranets, commerce, and marketing sites.
